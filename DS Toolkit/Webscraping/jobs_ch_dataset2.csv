   We’re looking for senior engineers with solid Python skills to join our team, which is building a platform, called Squirro, for unstructured data analysis. Squirro can ingest data from anywhere, be it public on the web or social medium or internal, such as a CRM, database or ITSM system, and add structure to it so that it can be delivered to business users using our dashboard visualisations or consumed by other systems using our APIs. We add structure to unstructured data by employing a range of techniques, from statistical and Bayesian models to supervised and unsupervised machine learning which we serve to our customers as a unified and patented technology we call Smartfilters. Meanwhile, for our users, we provide a simple interface to access these technologies so that anyone with basic analytical skills can get value out of their companies unstructured data. You can try Squirro for yourself here. An example use case for Squirro could be analysing customer support emails. One of our customers may be processing thousands of support requests every day from their customers. Squirro adds structure those emails by clustering them into groups such as “address change”, “billing inquiry”, “unhappy customer” thereby enabling our customer to process those emails more efficiently and address unhappy customers quickly, before they churn. What’s more, they could employ our patent-pending trend detection system to identify to unusual spikes or drops in activity. Our customers are some of the largest banks and financial institutions in the world, across the US, UK, EU, Switzerland and Asia. Many of our customers are just beginning to discover the potential of unstructured data analysis and we’re excited by the opportunity as an early mover in this young market. While we host some of these customers in the cloud, the majority prefer to install Squirro on-premise for security reasons. We need you to help us build out and scale this platform, as our customers apply it to ever growing volumes of data and discover new ways to structure and analyse that data.  Required Qualifications   Exceptional programming experience in Python Extensive knowledge of UNIX/Linux from a developers perspective Strong track record in software systems design, from initial implementation to performance optimisation and scaling Experience developing professionally as part of a team, giving and receiving code reviews, test-driven development etc. Good communication skills with fluency in English Swiss citizenship or work permit in Switzerland, or living and working in UK, EU or EFTA member state. We’d love to hire people worldwide but Swiss immigration law makes this problematic except in rare cases.   Nice to Have   BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science or related technical field Experience with information retrieval technologies (Elasticsearch, Lucene) Comfortable working with large datasets and designing systems able to process and scale up to large data volumes Familiarity with RESTful web services and microservices architectures Experience with MySQL, Redis, nginx, Zookeeper and other technologies in the Squirro stack ( see How Squirro Scales ) Familiarity with AWS, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Ansible and other DevOps related tools Awareness of machine learning as applied to text analysis   Working with Us  Squirro is a Swiss startup with an international flavour.

Positions          RUST programming language in the HPC environment    RUST is a new open-source systems programming language created by Mozilla and a community of volunteers, designed to help developers create fast, secure applications which take full advantage of the powerful features of modern multi-core processors. It combines performance, reliability and productivity at the same time. Several big projects such as Servo (Mozilla’s brand-new browser engine) and Redox (a full Unix-like operating system) are written in this language. One of the key features of RUST is the ownership model that guarantees the memory-safety and thread-safety. It has many other interesting features, such as a standardised build system, package manager, pattern matching, support for complex numbers, type inference, and efficient C bindings. All this potentially makes RUST a very appealing language for the software development on HPC platforms. The purpose of this internship program is to study RUST language in the current HPC environment at CSCS. The following questions are expected to be clarified during the internship: how to install and run RUST programs with ""user access"" rights on Piz Daint is MPI wrapper for RUST compatible with Cray’s implementation how to interface RUST program with numerical libraries, such as MKL, MAGMA, ScaLAPACK, cuBlasXt, etc. how to write GPU-enabled application in RUST; what are the complications or simplifications comparing to the C/C++/Fortran GPU applications how to debug and profile RUST-based programs how rich is the functionality of RUST, e.g. the availability of special mathematical functions, support of matrices or multi-dimensional arrays, etc. what is the performance of memory- and compute-bound algorithms in RUST comparing with baseline C++ implementation.  Duration: 3 months Supervisor: Anton Kozhevnikov Working place: Zürich      Evaluation and deployment of the VTK-m toolkit in ParaView    VTK-m is an open-source toolkit of scientific visualization algorithms for emerging processor architectures. VTK-m supports the fine-grained concurrency for data analysis and visualization algorithms required to drive extreme scale computing by providing abstract models for data and execution that can be applied to a variety of algorithms across many different processor architectures. VTK-m is designed to provide a pervasive parallelism throughout all its visualization algorithms, meaning that the algorithm is designed to operate with independent concurrency at the finest possible level throughout. Several backends can be enabled (CUDA, OpenMP, TBB). This internship will start from existing ParaView applications in BioMechanics, Fluid Mechanics and Astrophysics developed at CSCS and will propose a migration path to VTK-m, in order to assess the performance of this new toolkit. Great emphasis will be put on creating balanced implementations to get the most parallelism out of the available hardware and software resources.  Duration: 3 months Supervisor: Jean Favre Working place: Lugano      Data indexing and Data querying for large multi-dimensional data    Visualization and Data Analytics are confronted with an ever-growing flow of massive datasets which should be indexed and queried in an intelligent manner to enable scientific discovery. There exists several toolkits and numerous publications in the field to address the issues of efficient data I/O, run-time compression and indexing (for example within HDF5-based ecosystems). This internship would pick demonstrations from the latest Supercomputing 2019 tutorial on I/O Frameworks and apply the lessons learned to the needs of a CSCS community (for example particle data archiving, indexing, querying, visualizing in Astrophysics).  Duration: 3 months Supervisor: Jean Favre Working place: Lugano      Using machine learning to help identifying applications running on the system    On HPC systems like Piz Daint several thousands of jobs are executed each day. Currently a system is in place analyzing each job submission script, trying to extract information such as the application in use via the name of the executable from the SRUN command. Unfortunately, classifying the application type based on the path and the executable name requires, to a large extent, human interaction. Yet still a considerable number of applications cannot be categorized and gets marked ‘user code’. We plan to apply supervised learning techniques to the classification task in order to reduce the amount of human interaction necessary and, at the same time, to increase the recognition rate of applications. Improving the accuracy of the generated list of applications will allow us to optimize the engagement with the different communities, since a better overview of the system usage will become available. Furthermore, this will also benefit the recently developed framework for the identification of performance issues. It can use the more accurate information trying to establish a connection between performance changes occurring on the system with applications overusing shared resources.  Main tasks during the 3-month internship:   Familiarization with the systems of CSCS. Defining the machine learning approach to be used for the analysis. Implementing the data extraction and the machine learning algorithm - validation of the tool. Documentation and presentation.   Prerequisites: The applicant should be comfortable with Python and have a background in machine learning. Duration: 3 months Supervisor(s): Matthias Kraushaar and Victor Holanda Rusu Working place: Lugano      Live performance dashboard in Python    Task-based programming frameworks like HPX and Dask are complex systems to understand and thus benefit from interactive tools that allow users to more easily understand how the underlying runtime system is executing tasks. Dask provides a web interface for displaying information about the current state of the task execution graph, identifying performance issues, and debugging failures. Python makes it very easy to deploy this kind of real-time interactive applications. C++ applications don’t enjoy the same ease of development. However, for performance insensitive parts of an application, such as visualizing performance data, Python tools can be leveraged to bring these capabilities to C++ applications with less effort. The Dask dashboard is developed using Bokeh. Bokeh is a fundamental and well-known Python library for building interactive visualizations in the browser, especially suited for displaying streaming data in real time. Bokeh also integrates effortlessly into Jupyter notebooks. It allows Python programmers to develop web applications without knowledge of HTML and Javascript. We propose to develop a performance dashboard in Python with Bokeh, inspired by the Dask dashboard, to display performance data produced by the HPX library. HPX already produces performance counter data natively for resource and network usage. However, users have to manually inspect and process the raw text logs. The dashboard would allow visualizing this data in real-time, making the data more easily digestible and reducing the development cycle. In addition, HPX can produce task profile data using the APEX and OTF2 libraries. This data could also be visualized in the dashboard to produce live task stream plots, making it easier to identify performance problems in parallel applications. HPX is a driver application for developing the performance dashboard, and if successful the dashboard can be extended to support more generic data sources and ways of displaying data. An example of another application that could benefit from this is GridTools. Finally, the dashboard would also serve as an educational tool for use in tutorials and courses. At the same time it could help promote CSCS developments in the scientific community by presenting them in a more approachable way.  Goals:   Develop an open-source performance dashboard to help performance analysis and debugging of HPX applications. Use the performance dashboard as a tool to demonstrate the capabilities of HPX and other CSCS frameworks (GridTools). Work towards enabling interactive supercomputing with HPX through Jupyter notebooks. Opportunity to find skilled Python developers.   Milestones:   Visualize HPX performance counter data in a browser. Visualize HPX task stream plot. Visualize task DAG for HPX. Abstract away parsing of HPX data to allow for other data sources. Visualize GridTools kernel data as a task stream plot.  References:  HPX documentation: https://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/sphinx/latest/html/index.html  Dask documentation: https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web.html  Bokeh documentation: https://bokeh.pydata.org  Programmatic Bokeh servers: https://matthewrocklin.com/blog//work/2017/06/28/simple-bokeh-server    Prerequisites: The candidate should be competent and independent in Python. Duration: 3 months Supervisor(s): Enrique González Paredes and Mikael Simberg Working place: Zurich      FFTW    CSCS offers computing services for the scientific community. As such it relies on performance and sanity tests for existing and newly procures machines. Besides established tests like HPL, DGEMM, ... we want to add FFT tests to our test procedure, since they are part of many applications running on our machines. In particular for some graphics processing unit (GPU) applications this CPU (or GPU) part is a performance bottleneck. These tests will be performed on small scale and large-scale representing material science applications and cosmological applications, respectively. The new test will be based on FFTW and other publicly available FFT libraries. For different sizes of the FFT the performance will be measured and systematised. Existing FFT benchmarks will be evaluated as part of the work.  Prerequisites: The candidate should have basic C/C++ knowledge.

Firstfocus of development has been Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Today, patients diagnosedwith ASD account for 1-1.5% of the world population. The condition remains a high unmetmedical need.In its Geneva and Barcelona units, STALICLA has assembled a world class team ofexperienced drug developers and computational biologists. The company is recognized as adisruptive player, using its DEPIv3 AI & statistical modelling platform to identify subgroupsof patients with ASD and corresponding candidate drugs.It is the first time that such technologies have been utilized within the fieldof neurodevelopment with the potential to change the direction of the specialty.Patients are then characterized through biomarker preclinical and clinical investigations.  In just over 2 years, the STALICLA platform has already proven successful in  expediting and de-risking drug development for a first subgroup of patients with  Autism and identifying two additional subgroups.  STALICLA’s first therapeutic package - STP1 - addresses a distinct sub-group of ASD patientsestimated to 1.5-2M people in the EU and North America. Clinical entry for STP1 is plannedin Q1 2020.To support its platform and pipeline development, STALICLA has developed a network of toptier research and clinical partners in the US.This has enabled STALICLA to gather one of the largest Autism patient Electronic HealthRecord databases to date. STALICLA is currently applying its DEPIv3 discovery model to advance new pipelines foradditional groups of patients.In Q1 2019 – Three new modules have been added to the DEPIv3 platform, exponentiallyincreasing its capacities for single and combination drug repositioning and for identificationof clinical trial stage drug high responder patients.
