   We’re looking for senior engineers with solid Python skills to join our team, which is building a platform, called Squirro, for unstructured data analysis. Squirro can ingest data from anywhere, be it public on the web or social medium or internal, such as a CRM, database or ITSM system, and add structure to it so that it can be delivered to business users using our dashboard visualisations or consumed by other systems using our APIs. We add structure to unstructured data by employing a range of techniques, from statistical and Bayesian models to supervised and unsupervised machine learning which we serve to our customers as a unified and patented technology we call Smartfilters. Meanwhile, for our users, we provide a simple interface to access these technologies so that anyone with basic analytical skills can get value out of their companies unstructured data. You can try Squirro for yourself here. An example use case for Squirro could be analysing customer support emails. One of our customers may be processing thousands of support requests every day from their customers. Squirro adds structure those emails by clustering them into groups such as “address change”, “billing inquiry”, “unhappy customer” thereby enabling our customer to process those emails more efficiently and address unhappy customers quickly, before they churn. What’s more, they could employ our patent-pending trend detection system to identify to unusual spikes or drops in activity. Our customers are some of the largest banks and financial institutions in the world, across the US, UK, EU, Switzerland and Asia. Many of our customers are just beginning to discover the potential of unstructured data analysis and we’re excited by the opportunity as an early mover in this young market. While we host some of these customers in the cloud, the majority prefer to install Squirro on-premise for security reasons. We need you to help us build out and scale this platform, as our customers apply it to ever growing volumes of data and discover new ways to structure and analyse that data.  Required Qualifications   Exceptional programming experience in Python Extensive knowledge of UNIX/Linux from a developers perspective Strong track record in software systems design, from initial implementation to performance optimisation and scaling Experience developing professionally as part of a team, giving and receiving code reviews, test-driven development etc. Good communication skills with fluency in English Swiss citizenship or work permit in Switzerland, or living and working in UK, EU or EFTA member state. We’d love to hire people worldwide but Swiss immigration law makes this problematic except in rare cases.

 Automatic Segmentation of Medical Image Data Based on Deep Learning          Semester and Master's Work at the IT'IS Foundation - Automatic Segmentation of Medical Image Data Based on Deep Learning         Automatic segmentation of brain structures often is performed by means of image registration techniques that deform a template segmentation onto the target image, thereby generating a probable segmentation of the target patient data. The recent explosion of research and applications built on machine-earning approaches, such as deep neural networks, suggest promising alternatives. The aim of this project is to develop a framework that allows deep learning models of segmented structures to be easily built, including systematic building of databases of annotated segmented image data and evaluation of different learning strategies and models. For this purpose, the student will be provided with a collection of multi-modal image data of the head region together with manually segmented tissue structures for training the models. Depending on the interest and ability of the student, the resulting framework will be integrated in the commercial software iSEG. Good C++ or Python skills are prefered. As a prerequisite, the student will have attended at least one course on machine learning. The project will give the student the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with these exciting techniques. The extent of the project will be defined and finalized according to the interests and background of the student. The workplace will be at the IT’IS Foundation in Zurich.

Data Python,Master Internship - Human Rendering System for Realistic Video Data Generation,2019-11-16,,,100%,Position with responsibilities,"Master Internship - Human Rendering System for Realistic Video Data GenerationThe Embedded Vision System group of CSEM is currently offering a master internship in the domain of: 
The Embedded Vision System group of CSEM is currently offering a master internship in the domain of:  Human Rendering System for Realistic Video Data Generation    One of the most important factors for the success seen in deep learning applications is the availability of large-scale datasets with ground truth annotations. This is partly due to the fact that today’s most successful approaches are fully supervised. Deep learning algorithms, particularly, fall short of generalizing well to unseen cases from only a few data samples, which is due to their large capacity to model patterns in the data, and hence, higher chance of overfitting under weak regularization. As a result, the major challenge in many modern artificial intelligence (AI) projects today is the requirement for collecting a large-enough dataset with ground truth labels. Obtaining such a dataset manually using only human annotators is not only time consuming and costly, but also not scalable.    Your mission  An attractive approach to tackle this problem involves synthetically rendering realistic scenes with moving synthetic humans and other objects in them. Augmenting a small real dataset with such a large synthetic one has proven to improve classification accuracy in several application domains including eye gaze estimation from still images. The project aims at developing such a rendering system entirely from publicly available resources to generate realistic video sequences with high levels of variation in them (i.e., various actions, objects, backgrounds etc). To analyse the state-of-the-art in realistic scene rendering techniques involving humans as well as a large collection of inanimate objects. The candidate is expected to present their results at the end of the project, which will last a minimum of 6 months.    Your profile  You have a background in computer graphics or a similar domain. Experience in scene and/or human body rendering techniques and tools is a plus. You are skilled in programming in at least the python language. You are a good team player ready to take technical challenges.    We offer  CSEM offers a stimulating and multidisciplinary work environment with the opportunity to work with leading Swiss and international companies. You will have the opportunity to benefit from excellent social security conditions and to evolve within a multicultural company which clearly promotes an employee-driven culture.

Data Python,"PhD position - Big Data Analysis using Artificial Intelligence in Railway Measurement and Grinding 100%, Zurich, temporary",2019-11-16,ETH Zürich,Zürich,100%,Position with responsibilities,"PhD position - Big Data Analysis using Artificial Intelligence in Railway Measurement and Grinding 100%, Zurich, temporaryPhD position – Big Data Analysis using Artificial Intelligence in Railway Measurement and Grinding 100%, Zurich, temporary  The Institute of Machine Tools and Manufacturing (IWF) at the Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering performs international leading research on machine tools and in the field of production engineering. A further research focus is on novel topics such as additive manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Big Data Analysis or Industry 4.0. For a new industry related research project, we are looking for a new PhD candidate.  Project background  The traveling velocity of Swiss pendolino reaching 250 km/h creates both aerodynamic noise as well as noise from the train wheel – track interaction. The rolling noise contributes significantly to the overall acoustic pollution. The results of sonRAIL study showed direct correlation between the noise development and the surface quality of rail and wheel. The high velocity of the train is the main challenge for in-situ measurements of the surface roughness and waviness. Another obstacle is the data processing. Artificial Intelligence (AI) needs to be used for feature extraction out of the huge amount of data (Big Data). State of the art in dry grinding technology of railways induces increasing noise after the grinding process. The noise only decreases after some train overrun which smooths the surface of the rails. A closed loop system with integrated Machine Learning (ML) for the detection of optimal process parameters for railway grinding needs to be developed.  Job description  The PhD student participating in this research project is expected to develop a closed loop model for rail measurement, assesment and improvement. Through the close cooperation with our project partners, she/he will quickly establish contacts with Swiss industry. In our young teams, he/she will work at the forefront of today's knowledge in manufacturing. We offer a modern working environment in a young and motivated team and an interesting topic in a fast growing field of research. This position is a 100% employment and the place of work is Zurich.  Your profile  Requirements: The applicant has to have a master degree in Engineering or Physics. The position is coupled with the possibility of a PhD study at ETH Zurich. Qualified candidates should have the following capabilities:  Good knowledge of data analysis and signal processing Programming experience, preferably in Python Competences in Information Technology  The candidate is highly motivated and eager to learn. In addition, he/she likes to combine theoretical considerations and models with experimental tasks, having valuable technical skills.

Data Python,"PhD position in ocean biogeochemical modeling and data analyses 100%, Zurich, temporary",2019-11-16,ETH Zürich,Zürich,100%,Position with responsibilities,"PhD position in ocean biogeochemical modeling and data analyses 100%, Zurich, temporaryPhD position in ocean biogeochemical modeling and data analyses 100%, Zurich, temporary  The Environmental Physics Group is a vibrant interdisciplinary team of researchers studying climate change with a focus on the interaction between the Earth’s biogeochemical cycles and its climate system.  Project background  An aspect of growing concern is the possibility that Earth’s climate system might reach or even cross critical thresholds, i.e., points beyond which aspects of this system change abruptly, and possibly irreversibly. The latter are often referred to as “tipping points”. Our current knowledge about the distribution, timing and impacts of these critical thresholds is poor, especially with regard to ocean biogeochemical properties, such as ocean acidification. To study such thresholds and tipping points in the ocean, we are offering one PhD position in ocean biogeochemical modeling and data analyses within the framework of the COMFORT project funded by European Commission (https://comfort.w.uib.no). This project with more than 20 international partners aims to “close knowledge gaps for key ocean tipping elements within the Earth system under anthropogenic physical and chemical climate forcing through a coherent interdisciplinary research approach”. COMFORT’s research focuses on the triple threat of ocean (1) warming, (2) deoxygenation, and (3) ocean acidification and the critical thresholds that these stressors may reach in the future. Extremes may be particularly important, as they can push systems beyond such thresholds at a time when the mean change is still small.  Job description  The successful Ph.D. candidate will investigate how ocean warming, ocean deoxygenation, and ocean acidification have evolved in the Southern Ocean in the past, and might evolve in the future with a focus on extreme events. Of particular concern are compound events, i.e., conditions when several of the drivers are extreme at the same time, or in close temporal proximity. The primary investigative tool will be a high-resolution Southern Ocean configuration of the Regional Oceanic Modeling System coupled to a state-of-the-art biogeochemical/ecological model. The candidate will also work extensively with observations, including those from a growing array of biogeochemical floats. The PhD student will be supervised jointly by Prof. Nicolas Gruber, Dr. Meike Vogt and Dr. Matthias Münnich. The Ph.D. candidate is expected to collaborate closely with the “Extremes” team of the Environmental Physics Group (3 Ph.D. and 1 postdoc) and to take advantage of the many networking opportunities within the COMFORT project. The starting date of this position is early 2020. Funding is guaranteed for four years.  Your profile  The ideal candidate has a master degree in atmospheric, oceanic and/or climate sciences, physics, computational sciences or a closely related discipline. Your English is fluent and you have excellent communication skills. You have experience with a higher programming language (e.g., Fortran, C, Matlab, Python) and a strong interest to work in a highly interdisciplinary and international environment.

Positions          RUST programming language in the HPC environment    RUST is a new open-source systems programming language created by Mozilla and a community of volunteers, designed to help developers create fast, secure applications which take full advantage of the powerful features of modern multi-core processors. It combines performance, reliability and productivity at the same time. Several big projects such as Servo (Mozilla’s brand-new browser engine) and Redox (a full Unix-like operating system) are written in this language. One of the key features of RUST is the ownership model that guarantees the memory-safety and thread-safety. It has many other interesting features, such as a standardised build system, package manager, pattern matching, support for complex numbers, type inference, and efficient C bindings. All this potentially makes RUST a very appealing language for the software development on HPC platforms. The purpose of this internship program is to study RUST language in the current HPC environment at CSCS. The following questions are expected to be clarified during the internship: how to install and run RUST programs with ""user access"" rights on Piz Daint is MPI wrapper for RUST compatible with Cray’s implementation how to interface RUST program with numerical libraries, such as MKL, MAGMA, ScaLAPACK, cuBlasXt, etc. how to write GPU-enabled application in RUST; what are the complications or simplifications comparing to the C/C++/Fortran GPU applications how to debug and profile RUST-based programs how rich is the functionality of RUST, e.g. the availability of special mathematical functions, support of matrices or multi-dimensional arrays, etc. what is the performance of memory- and compute-bound algorithms in RUST comparing with baseline C++ implementation.  Duration: 3 months Supervisor: Anton Kozhevnikov Working place: Zürich      Evaluation and deployment of the VTK-m toolkit in ParaView    VTK-m is an open-source toolkit of scientific visualization algorithms for emerging processor architectures. VTK-m supports the fine-grained concurrency for data analysis and visualization algorithms required to drive extreme scale computing by providing abstract models for data and execution that can be applied to a variety of algorithms across many different processor architectures. VTK-m is designed to provide a pervasive parallelism throughout all its visualization algorithms, meaning that the algorithm is designed to operate with independent concurrency at the finest possible level throughout. Several backends can be enabled (CUDA, OpenMP, TBB). This internship will start from existing ParaView applications in BioMechanics, Fluid Mechanics and Astrophysics developed at CSCS and will propose a migration path to VTK-m, in order to assess the performance of this new toolkit. Great emphasis will be put on creating balanced implementations to get the most parallelism out of the available hardware and software resources.  Duration: 3 months Supervisor: Jean Favre Working place: Lugano      Data indexing and Data querying for large multi-dimensional data    Visualization and Data Analytics are confronted with an ever-growing flow of massive datasets which should be indexed and queried in an intelligent manner to enable scientific discovery. There exists several toolkits and numerous publications in the field to address the issues of efficient data I/O, run-time compression and indexing (for example within HDF5-based ecosystems). This internship would pick demonstrations from the latest Supercomputing 2019 tutorial on I/O Frameworks and apply the lessons learned to the needs of a CSCS community (for example particle data archiving, indexing, querying, visualizing in Astrophysics).  Duration: 3 months Supervisor: Jean Favre Working place: Lugano      Using machine learning to help identifying applications running on the system    On HPC systems like Piz Daint several thousands of jobs are executed each day. Currently a system is in place analyzing each job submission script, trying to extract information such as the application in use via the name of the executable from the SRUN command. Unfortunately, classifying the application type based on the path and the executable name requires, to a large extent, human interaction. Yet still a considerable number of applications cannot be categorized and gets marked ‘user code’. We plan to apply supervised learning techniques to the classification task in order to reduce the amount of human interaction necessary and, at the same time, to increase the recognition rate of applications. Improving the accuracy of the generated list of applications will allow us to optimize the engagement with the different communities, since a better overview of the system usage will become available. Furthermore, this will also benefit the recently developed framework for the identification of performance issues. It can use the more accurate information trying to establish a connection between performance changes occurring on the system with applications overusing shared resources.  Main tasks during the 3-month internship:   Familiarization with the systems of CSCS. Defining the machine learning approach to be used for the analysis. Implementing the data extraction and the machine learning algorithm - validation of the tool. Documentation and presentation.   Prerequisites: The applicant should be comfortable with Python and have a background in machine learning. Duration: 3 months Supervisor(s): Matthias Kraushaar and Victor Holanda Rusu Working place: Lugano      Live performance dashboard in Python    Task-based programming frameworks like HPX and Dask are complex systems to understand and thus benefit from interactive tools that allow users to more easily understand how the underlying runtime system is executing tasks. Dask provides a web interface for displaying information about the current state of the task execution graph, identifying performance issues, and debugging failures. Python makes it very easy to deploy this kind of real-time interactive applications. C++ applications don’t enjoy the same ease of development. However, for performance insensitive parts of an application, such as visualizing performance data, Python tools can be leveraged to bring these capabilities to C++ applications with less effort. The Dask dashboard is developed using Bokeh. Bokeh is a fundamental and well-known Python library for building interactive visualizations in the browser, especially suited for displaying streaming data in real time. Bokeh also integrates effortlessly into Jupyter notebooks. It allows Python programmers to develop web applications without knowledge of HTML and Javascript. We propose to develop a performance dashboard in Python with Bokeh, inspired by the Dask dashboard, to display performance data produced by the HPX library. HPX already produces performance counter data natively for resource and network usage. However, users have to manually inspect and process the raw text logs. The dashboard would allow visualizing this data in real-time, making the data more easily digestible and reducing the development cycle. In addition, HPX can produce task profile data using the APEX and OTF2 libraries. This data could also be visualized in the dashboard to produce live task stream plots, making it easier to identify performance problems in parallel applications. HPX is a driver application for developing the performance dashboard, and if successful the dashboard can be extended to support more generic data sources and ways of displaying data. An example of another application that could benefit from this is GridTools. Finally, the dashboard would also serve as an educational tool for use in tutorials and courses. At the same time it could help promote CSCS developments in the scientific community by presenting them in a more approachable way.  Goals:   Develop an open-source performance dashboard to help performance analysis and debugging of HPX applications. Use the performance dashboard as a tool to demonstrate the capabilities of HPX and other CSCS frameworks (GridTools). Work towards enabling interactive supercomputing with HPX through Jupyter notebooks. Opportunity to find skilled Python developers.   Milestones:   Visualize HPX performance counter data in a browser. Visualize HPX task stream plot. Visualize task DAG for HPX. Abstract away parsing of HPX data to allow for other data sources. Visualize GridTools kernel data as a task stream plot.  References:  HPX documentation: https://stellar-group.github.io/hpx/docs/sphinx/latest/html/index.html  Dask documentation: https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web.html  Bokeh documentation: https://bokeh.pydata.org  Programmatic Bokeh servers: https://matthewrocklin.com/blog//work/2017/06/28/simple-bokeh-server    Prerequisites: The candidate should be competent and independent in Python. Duration: 3 months Supervisor(s): Enrique González Paredes and Mikael Simberg Working place: Zurich      FFTW    CSCS offers computing services for the scientific community. As such it relies on performance and sanity tests for existing and newly procures machines. Besides established tests like HPL, DGEMM, ... we want to add FFT tests to our test procedure, since they are part of many applications running on our machines. In particular for some graphics processing unit (GPU) applications this CPU (or GPU) part is a performance bottleneck. These tests will be performed on small scale and large-scale representing material science applications and cosmological applications, respectively. The new test will be based on FFTW and other publicly available FFT libraries. For different sizes of the FFT the performance will be measured and systematised. Existing FFT benchmarks will be evaluated as part of the work.  Prerequisites: The candidate should have basic C/C++ knowledge.

Data Python,Master's Thesis/ Lab immersion Auditory Language Group,2019-11-16,,,100%,Position with responsibilities,"Master's Thesis/ Lab immersion Auditory Language Group Description du poste  Job Description  Aphasia is an impairment in the comprehension and formulation of language caused most commonly by stroke, traumatic brain-injuries, and other pathological conditions affecting the motor production of speech. Current neuro-rehabilitation techniques are effective only partially and in a fraction of patients, leaving the remaining in the impossibility to communicate with theexternal world.The proposed internship is part of Braincom, a multi-disciplinary European project, whose main goal is the development of a new generation of speech neuroprosthesis to restore communication in aphasic patients. The approach is based on the real-time decoding of inner speech from sensory and speech motor cortex through the use of non-invasive (EEG/MEG) and intracranial recordings (ECoG). The first part of this internship will consist in characterizing the neural signatures of mental imagery of syllables - the “building blocks” of words – from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in healthy participants. More specifically, we aim at identifying (1) the best time window around the onset of the syllable-imagery and (2) the most relevant brain regions ableto optimally discriminate between two different imagined syllables.In the second part of the project, these spatio-temporal features will be integrated into a closed-loop brain-machine interface, capable of decoding in real-time participants’ imaginedsyllable and, according to the classifier output, provide an auditory feedback.  Tasks:   (Paradigm implementation, TBD) EEG data recording Analysis of EEG data Integration into BCI framework   Application:  Please provide the following information in the e-mail:  Which project type are you interested in (e.g. master project)? In which program are you enrolled and what year are you in (e.g. 3rd year bachelor student in SV)?

 Computational Algorithms for Semi-Automatic Image Processing for Targeted Epidural Electrical Stimulation    Semester and Master's Work at the IT'IS Foundation – Computational Algorithms for Semi-Automatic Image Processing for Targeted Epidural Electrical Stimulation     Central nervous system disorders such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke lead to distinct impairments in motor control and balance. Epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of lumbar and sacral segments of the spinal cord has been proven to restore voluntary and coordinated movements of the lower limbs in various animal models.   Translation of this technology to the treatment of human patients requires the development of dedicated, robust solutions for clinical use. Indeed, therapeutic success of EES entails the definition of dedicated spinal electrode arrays and stimulation strategies that can account for the large variability observed in clinical populations. Personalization of implantation procedures and stimulation protocols will be critical for being able to address the specific motor deficits in large and diversified patient cohorts. The RESTORE team – a collaboration between the IT’IS Foundation, ZurichMedTech, EPFL, GTX Medical and the UMCU – is currently working on establishing a computational framework for the creation of personalized computational models for the development of targeted EES strategies to promote recovery of motor function after SCI. This framework has already been proven to create a 1-to-1 mapping between simulation and experiment and is currently being advanced to optimize stimulation paradigms. However, the extraction of anatomical features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is slow and requires a tremendous amount of human effort. We therefore aim to develop image processing algorithms for semi-automatic to automatic extraction of key features. The aim of this master’s thesis project is the development and implementation of image processing algorithms that can be used to extract the trajectory of the spinal roots from MRI data sets. To this end, the student will be provided with MRI data sets and a computational framework able to extract the center-lines of the spinal roots. The student is required to develop an algorithm based on Kalman filtering to improve the labelling and selection of these spinal roots. The successful candidate will have:      experience with programming in C++ and/or Python experience with image-processing experience and/or interest in machine learning experience and/or interest in 3D computer-aided-design modelling      The workplace will be at the IT’IS Foundation in Zurich.

Current neuro-rehabilitation techniques are effective only partially and in a fraction of patients, leaving the remaining in the impossibility to communicate with theexternal world.The proposed internship is part of Braincom, a multi-disciplinary European project, whose main goal is the development of a new generation of speech neuroprosthesis to restore communication in aphasic patients. The approach is based on the real-time decoding of inner speech from sensory and speech motor cortex through the use of non-invasive (EEG/MEG) and intracranial recordings (ECoG). The first part of this internship will consist in characterizing the neural signatures of mental imagery of syllables - the “building blocks” of words – from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in healthy participants. More specifically, we aim at identifying (1) the best time window around the onset of the syllable-imagery and (2) the most relevant brain regions ableto optimally discriminate between two different imagined syllables.In the second part of the project, these spatio-temporal features will be integrated into a closed-loop brain-machine interface, capable of decoding in real-time participants’ imaginedsyllable and, according to the classifier output, provide an auditory feedback.  Tasks:   (Paradigm implementation, TBD) EEG data recording Analysis of EEG data Integration into BCI framework   Application:  Please provide the following information in the e-mail:  Which project type are you interested in (e.g. master project)? In which program are you enrolled and what year are you in (e.g. 3rd year bachelor student in SV)? How long does this type of project usually last and how many ECTS credits do you receive for it (e.g. 3 weeks full-time, 6 ECTS credits)? What are the deadlines and presentation modes for the project (e.g. presentation during project and written report afterwards)? In what period would you like to perform the project in our laboratory (e.g. 1st of September until 1st March, full-time)?

Until now, cities and mobility services have been designed based on assumptions of how officials and companies expect people to move. But, they aren’t taking everyone’s journey into consideration. As a result, for many, mobility is limited. Not just physically, but socially and economically. It’s stopping people from reaching their full potential.  Teralytics partners with mobile network operators to solve this problem with the most accurate indicator of people’s movement – their mobile devices. It’s the one thing everyone has with them at all times. And the cell towers receiving their signals don’t discriminate based on device model or apps. Due to its complexity and scale, mobile network data has been nearly impossible to understand or utilize. That’s why we’ve pioneered a way to translate it into actionable insights. For the first time we’ve unlocked truly inclusive data on people’s journeys. Teralytics is backed by leading investors in the mobility and transport space, including Robert Bosch Venture Capital and Deutsche Bahn Digital Ventures, as well as high-profile VC funds, such as Atomico and Lakestar, and we are continuing to grow across the world. Whether at our headquarters in Zurich or in our offices in New York and Singapore, our people are at the core of our mission to shape the future of mobility.  What we offer  We offer the chance to be part of an exciting and ambitious start-up that puts its people at the heart of its business. Be part of a diverse, international, cross-disciplinary team of highly motivated, hands-on experts that tackle unique challenges with a positive spirit and lots of fun. We offer a flexible work schedule, a central office location as well as a wide range of benefits and perks, including financial childcare support, additional company holidays, and career development programs.  What to expect  Teralytics is an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Data Python,Master's student Interpretability for computational biology,2019-11-16,IBM Research GmbH,Rüschlikon,100%,Position with responsibilities,"Master's student Interpretability for computational biology   Master’s student position Interpretability for computational biology  Ref. 2019-08 Project description Understanding real-world datasets is often challenging due to size, complexity and/or poor knowledge about the problem to be tackled (i.e. electronic health records, OMICS data, etc.). To achieve high accuracy for important tasks, equally complex machine/deep-learning models are usually used. In many situations, the decisions achieved by such automated systems can have significant—and potentially deleterious—consequences. The goal of this project is to analyze and benchmark the performance of existing interpretability methods and strategies [1,2] relative to various tasks in computational biology (e.g. transcription factor-binding prediction, cancer type classification). In particular, the student will focus on mass cytometry data [3]. Specifically, the student will perform the following tasks:  Extensive literature review of existing interpretability methods, and (if interested) of philosophical and psychological essays about interpretability. If code is not provided, reimplement some of the existing methods.  Define the desiderata of an interpretability method in the context of cell subpopulation identification using CyTOF data, and accordingly design performance metrics to benchmark and compare existing methods systematically for interpretability.  Develop a new interpretability method and compare it to existing methods.  Requirements  Working knowledge of Python, or equivalent. Comfortable knowledge of statistics and machine learning.  In addition, a background in either systems biology, applied mathematics, or cognitive sciences could be beneficial, although it is not essential.

Eawag conducts research, education and expert consulting to achieve the dual goals of meeting direct human needs for water and maintaining the function and integrity of aquatic ecosystems.  The Department of Surface Waters – Research and Management (Surf) is seeking a highly motivated  Postdoctoral Fellow in hyperspectral remote sensing of lake water quality   The aim of this position is to explore the use of automated optical ground measurements and hydrodynamic simulations for the development of a new water quality retrieval algorithm for hyperspectral data. The position is part of a collaboration between Eawag, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, and the University of Zurich. Since summer 2019, measurements of inherent and apparent optical properties are recorded several times a day nearby a research platform in Lake Geneva (www.lexplore.ch), while hydrodynamic circulation is simulated with an operational 3D hydrodynamic model (www.meteolakes.ch). Remote sensing of water quality parameters is typically limited by assumptions concerning optical properties and their vertical homogeneity. Using automated measurements and simulations, we can replace current assumptions with qualified information and consequently enable better remote sensing algorithms.  We are looking for a motivated person at the post-doc level who will be involved in the following tasks:• Development of a processing chain for hyperspectral data using existing methods• Investigate relationships between vertical density gradients and opticalnon-uniformities• Identify spectral features that are sensitive to optical non-uniformities• Implement and validate a retrieval algorithm that exploits hyperspectral, ground measured and simulated data at once  The successful candidate will have a PhD in remote sensing, data science, or similar. He/she will have an in-depth understanding of statistical analysis and excellent programming skills (e.g. Python, Matlab).

But, they aren’t taking everyone’s journey into consideration. As a result, for many, mobility is limited. Not just physically, but socially and economically. It’s stopping people from reaching their full potential.  Teralytics partners with mobile network operators to solve this problem with the most accurate indicator of people’s movement – their mobile devices. It’s the one thing everyone has with them at all times. And the cell towers receiving their signals don’t discriminate based on device model or apps. Due to its complexity and scale, mobile network data has been nearly impossible to understand or utilize. That’s why we’ve pioneered a way to translate it into actionable insights. For the first time we’ve unlocked truly inclusive data on people’s journeys. Teralytics is backed by leading investors in the mobility and transport space, including Robert Bosch Venture Capital and Deutsche Bahn Digital Ventures, as well as high-profile VC funds, such as Atomico and Lakestar, and we are continuing to grow across the world.

Data Python,"PhD position in ""Modelling biodiversity impacts in LCA"" 100%, Zurich, temporary",2019-11-16,ETH Zürich,Zürich,100%,Position with responsibilities,"PhD position in ""Modelling biodiversity impacts in LCA"" 100%, Zurich, temporaryPhD position in “Modelling biodiversity impacts in LCA” 100%, Zurich, temporary  ETH Zurich and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission are inviting applications for PhD positions through the Collaborative Doctoral Partnership (CDP) scheme.  Project background  The CDP scheme intends to enhance the science-policy link through strategic collaborations with higher education institutions characterized by research excellence and international reputation, in order to:  Train a new generation of doctoral graduates in science and technology with a focus on the science-policy interface, able to understand the research needs at different stages of the policy cycle, capable of providing scientific support to policy and of using transferable skills in science communication and knowledge management. Co-develop, co-host and co-supervise doctoral studies between higher education institutions and the JRC. Strengthen collaboration between the JRC and higher education institutions by promoting mutual enhancement of related skills and competences, combining existing knowledge and capacities, and enhancing networking in key scientific areas.   Job description  Within the CDP framework we are looking for a PhD candidate to:  Understand and quantify the temporal trajectory of biodiversity loss after an intervention and recovery after restauration. Develop a model for “delays” in biodiversity response. Calibrate and/or validate the models with empirical data, e.g. the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA; www.dopa.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/applications) to assess biodiversity within and around protected areas (globally). Integrate the new findings into existing methods for life cycle impact assessment of biodiversity loss. Apply the new method(s) to case studies:  Assessment of future land-use policy scenarios. Comparison of national (territorial biodiversity impacts) and supply-chain (biodiversity footprint) perspective.    The objective of this PhD will be to support the development of refined models to address biodiversity impacts of supply chains, linking results with evidence of biodiversity loss at EU and global level. A theoretical and modelling framework for the use of micro data to better understand the dynamic of the biodiversity effect and recovery, to potentially validate biodiversity impacts estimates, to suggest policies that merge supply chain improvements and biodiversity conservations goals. In the first phase, during her/his stay in ETH, the PhD candidate will familiarize with existing biodiversity impact assessment models, conducting a sensitivity of the results and identifying inconsistencies and gaps in the assessment. Based on that, a proposal for a refined model addressing temporal trajectory of biodiversity will be developed, which considers different management and intervention intensities e.g. for land use, overexploitation of resources etc. The candidate will also write and defend her/his research plan. In a second phase during her/his stay at the JRC, the PhD candidate will further develop the model capitalizing on Earth observation data and indicators, calibrating and/or validating the models with empirical data, e.g. the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA; www.dopa.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/applications) to assess biodiversity within and around protected areas. At a final stage at ETH, the PhD candidate will test the model on different case studies. We offer a four-year PhD position in collaboration with the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. The PhD research will be realized at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra, Italy, for a period of up to 24 months. We offer a competitive fellowship. While at the JRC in Ispra, you will get a contract as a Grant Holder 20*.  Your profile   You have (or are near completion of) a Master in Environmental Sciences, Environmental Engineering, Ecology, Biology (or a related field).  You have a strong interest in biodiversity research and life cycle assessment and experience in at least one of these two fields.

Malaria continues to be an exceptional burden on global public health. While we have seen a worldwide decline in malaria incidence and mortality at the beginning of the 21st century, emerging resistance to antimalarials as well as insecticides pose threats to these trends. Vector control (targeting the mosquito instead of the parasite) through mass drug administration of systemic endectocides is a promising new strategy in malaria prevention. Pharmacometrics is a discipline that quantifies drugs, disease progression, and clinical trials using mathematical models. Its results directly improve patient care, provide personalized medicine, inform clinical trial design, and aid in drug development. Your applicationPlease only apply online.

Do you want to be passionate about your employer and the brand you represent? Everything is converging on the Internet, making networked connections more meaningful than ever before in our lives. Our employees' groundbreaking ideas impact everything imaginable - from entertainment, retail, healthcare, and education, to public and private sectors, smart cities, and everyday devices in our homes. Here, that means you will take creative ideas from the drawing board to dynamic solutions that have real world impact. You'll collaborate with Cisco leaders, partner with expert mentors, and develop incredible relationships with colleagues who share your interest in connecting the unconnected. You'll be part a team that cares about its customers, enjoys having fun, and you'll take part in changing the lives of those in our local communities. Come prepared to be encouraged and inspired!       What you’ll do:  Distributed software architectures are powerful but have their challenges, especially regarding debugging across devices. The traditional debugging method does not scale and that's because a call may involve multiple devices, and it's very hard to combine data to get a single stack trace. Therefore, tracing individual flows across a distributed system is an essential component in an observability system. However, current implementations focus on web applications and microservices. We want to build a modern distributing tracing system for a wireless solution. The system can gather information from the controller, the access point, and other deployed devices such as authentication servers and analytics services. Among others, use cases of such system include troubleshooting errors, anomaly detection, latency problems discovery, exploring dependencies, and validating functionality. Your activities will include:  Research state of the art on distributed tracing. Design of a low overhead code instrumentation system. Definition of the tracing data model. For example, sampling rates, entry points, system components, integration with other observability methods. Implementation and enablement of some flows. Integration with a tracing collector (e.g. telemetry collector, Zipkin, Cisco DNA-C, App Dynamics, custom).   Who you are:  Willing to learn and work in a team Independent and self driven Creative problem-solving mindset Enjoy looking at practical real-life challenges and thinking creatively to solve them.          What you need to be eligible:   Master student in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or a related major Strong knowledge of programming and scripting languages (C and a scripting language like Python) Good understanding of computer networks and networking technologies Fluent in English           Why Cisco #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?

The Embedded Vision System group of CSEM is currently offering a master internship in the domain of:  Efficient Deep Architectures for Hand Pose Estimation from Color Images  The project aims to develope efficient deep learning algorithms for human hand pose estimation from standard RGB camera images. State-of-the art approaches for hand pose estimation rely on depth cameras due to the inherent high-information content of depth images for the pose estimation problem as well as the availability of large-scale annotated depth datasets with ground-truth hand joint locations. Despite their recent success these algorithms are neither cost effective nor power efficient, which pose a barrier in application areas which need low-power, small-size and low-cost requirements.    Your mission  The project’s objective is to overcome this barrier by developing efficient deep learning architectures that would work solely on standard color image sequences. Due to the lack of large annotated RGB datasets in the public domain we plan to tackle this problem with a teacher-student learning paradigm, which involves training on a RGB-only deep network from a pre-trained state-of-the-art depth-based one using an RGBD sensor to collect synchronized RGB and depth image pairs. To analyse state of the are in hand pose estimation from various data modalities, and develope as well as train an RGB image-based deep network model entirely from public resources. Along with accuracy, computational and power efficiency of the network are major factors that will be considered from the beginning of the study. The candidate is expected to present their results at the end of the project, which will last a minimum of 6 months.    Your profile  You have a background in machine learning, especially deep learning techniques, computer vision, and programming in python. You are interested in understanding as well as designing intelligent algorithms and are a good team player.    We offer  CSEM offers a stimulating and multidisciplinary work environment with the opportunity to work with leading Swiss and international companies.

Data Python,"PhD Position in Precision Medicine for Neurological Disorders 100%, Basel, temporary",2019-11-16,ETH Zürich,Zürich,100%,Position with responsibilities,"PhD Position in Precision Medicine for Neurological Disorders 100%, Basel, temporaryPhD Position in Precision Medicine for Neurological Disorders 100%, Basel, temporary  The Machine Learning and Computational Biology Laboratory at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) is seeking a PhD Student in the field of Machine Learning for Health to start on January 1st, 2020. The student will be joining a highly interdisciplinary research team and will be supervised by Dr. Catherine Jutzeler and Prof. Karsten Borgwardt. The Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) is one of ETH Zurich's youngest departments and the only one located in Basel outside of the Zurich campus. It unites biologists, engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians to work towards a quantitative understanding and purposeful engineering of complex biological systems.  Job description  The PhD student will be funded by Dr. Catherine Jutzeler’s recently awarded Swiss National Science Foundation Ambizione Grant on precision medicine for neurological disorders. The focus of this project will be on traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, with the potential to expand to other neurological conditions. Both disorders, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, are highly heterogenous in terms of clinical presentation, disease progression, and associated comorbidities. This heterogeneity makes reliable prediction of future outcomes and patient stratification for clinical trials extremely challenging. The aims of this project are to (1) identify biomarkers that allow a better characterization of the patients (e.g., identification of homogenous subgroups, phenotypes, responders and non-responders); and (2) expedite the search for disease-modifying treatments through drug repurposing. To implicitly account for the multifaceted nature of the disorders, state-of-the-art machine learning methods will be applied to analyze multidimensional medical data (clinical, imaging, genetic, behavioral, and physiological), derived from completed clinical trials, health records, and observational studies. Machine learning topics relevant to the project include mining and learning on time series and graphs, kernel methods, graph kernels, multiple testing correction in ultra-high-dimensional spaces, feature selection in structured spaces, deep learning, and causal inference.   Your profile  Applicants should be highly motivated and creative, hold a Master’s Degree in computer science, bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics, medicine, or related fields. Moreover, candidates must be able to fluently communicate in English (oral and written) and be willing to work in a highly interactive, interdisciplinary, and international environment at the interface of machine learning and biomedicine. Academic excellence, a professional work attitude, and a proactive and self-driven work ethic are expected. Advanced computer skills, including use of statistical software such as R, Python, or C++ are an asset. The position is fully funded for 4 years, and it will be located in the Machine Learning and Computational Biology Laboratory at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at the ETH Campus in Basel. Ideally, the position should start on January 1, 2020.  ETH Zurich   ETH Zurich is one of the world’s leading universities specialising in science and technology. We are renowned for our excellent education, cutting-edge fundamental research and direct transfer of new knowledge into society.

Security issues: vulnerabilities and security hotspots 
Ultimately, we target all issues which can be found through static analysis, even if they require a very deep understanding of the code. The sky's the limit! We believe that, as a side effect, our analyzers should educate developers about coding best practices thanks to the rule descriptions and to the raised issues.

Develop new and maintain existing features for code analyzers for different programming languages (Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Swift, TSQL, etc.) 
Evolve the way our analyzers understand code by creating ever better models and develop new rules on top of them 
Contribute to code quality of the hundreds of thousands of developers around the world
