We are looking for a smart and passionate Frontend Engineer to join our Engineering Team in Zurich.  About Teralytics  Teralytics is on a mission to change how the world moves. Until now, cities and mobility services have been designed based on assumptions of how officials and companies expect people to move. But, they aren’t taking everyone’s journey into consideration. As a result, for many, mobility is limited. Not just physically, but socially and economically. It’s stopping people from reaching their full potential.  Teralytics partners with mobile network operators to solve this problem with the most accurate indicator of people’s movement – their mobile devices. It’s the one thing everyone has with them at all times. And the cell towers receiving their signals don’t discriminate based on device model or apps. Due to its complexity and scale, mobile network data has been nearly impossible to understand or utilize. That’s why we’ve pioneered a way to translate it into actionable insights. For the first time we’ve unlocked truly inclusive data on people’s journeys. Teralytics is backed by leading investors in the mobility and transport space, including Robert Bosch Venture Capital and Deutsche Bahn Digital Ventures, as well as high-profile VC funds, such as Atomico and Lakestar, and we are continuing to grow across the world.

Would you like to be part of a team fueled by positive energy, enthusiasm and supportive teammates?  About Teralytics  Teralytics is on a mission to change how the world moves.  Until now, cities and mobility services have been designed based on assumptions of how officials and companies expect people to move. But, they aren’t taking everyone’s journey into consideration. As a result, for many, mobility is limited. Not just physically, but socially and economically. It’s stopping people from reaching their full potential.  Teralytics partners with mobile network operators to solve this problem with the most accurate indicator of people’s movement – their mobile devices. It’s the one thing everyone has with them at all times. And the cell towers receiving their signals don’t discriminate based on device model or apps. Due to its complexity and scale, mobile network data has been nearly impossible to understand or utilize. That’s why we’ve pioneered a way to translate it into actionable insights. For the first time we’ve unlocked truly inclusive data on people’s journeys. Teralytics is backed by leading investors in the mobility and transport space, including Robert Bosch Venture Capital and Deutsche Bahn Digital Ventures, as well as high-profile VC funds, such as Atomico and Lakestar, and we are continuing to grow across the world.

Data Scientist,PhD Position Revealing Protein Binding Dynamics Using Time-Resolved Diffraction Experiments at SwissFEL (P1904),2019-11-16,Universität Basel,Basel,100%,Position with responsibilities,"PhD Position Revealing Protein Binding Dynamics Using Time-Resolved Diffraction Experiments at SwissFEL (P1904)         PhD Position: Revealing Protein Binding Dynamics Using Time-Resolved Diffraction Experiments at SwissFEL (P1904) 100% positions for 4 years, earliest starting date: 1. January 2020     The Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI) at the University of Basel invites highly motivated scientists to apply for the SNI PhD program in Nanoscience.      Your position  The successful applicant for this project will work at the PSI and at the University of Basel and will be supported by teams at both places. As protein crystallographic data collection critically depends on the sample preparation, we will first concentrate on the fabrication of sample holders to accommodate the crystalline samples, enclose them between ultrathin X-ray transparent films and provide access for the optical laser which are used to trigger the binding of a caged cofactor to the protein of interest. For typical measurements, we will need a few hundreds of support structures, which means that they must be mass-fabricated using silicon or polymer technologies. The nanotechnology lab at PSI will support the student in designing and fabricating the holders used for this specific study. Furthermore, the PSI nanotechnology lab is well linked to Macromolecular Crystallography Group at PSI with access to the PX beamlines and to SwissFEL. The PhD student will be involved in measurement campaigns in order to learn all the measurement techniques and data evaluation strategies before his/her own experiments at SwissFEL. With the help of the team at Uni Basel, the student will synthesize photocaged derivatives, and perform their characterization, crystallization and co-crystallization experiments. In the later phase of the project, he/she will design and produce and optimize by directed evolution new variants of the cofactor that allow addressing specific characteristics of streptavidin binding.    Your profile  For this highly interdisciplinary project, we are looking for a PhD student holding a master's degree in science or engineering, with experience in protein crystallography, nanofabrication technology and/or peptide synthesis and modification, and with a keen interest in method development for experiments at state-of-the art large scale facilities in order to address fundamental biochemical questions.      We offer you    Excellent scientific and social environment Very competitive employment conditions Membership in a very supportive and recognised community The successful candidate will join an attractive interdisciplinary programme together with the ~30 currently supported scientists. The SNI covers a wide variety of topics, including cutting edge quantum physics and chemistry, material science, nanotechnology, biochemistry, cell biology, or medical research.    Application / Contact  More information and the online application platform can be found at www.phd.nanoscience.ch. For questions please contact the head of the SNI PhD programme, Dr. Andreas Baumgartner (andreas.baumgartner@unibas.ch), or directly the respective project leaders. The complete application has to be submitted before 31 December 2019.

Data Scientist,"PhD Position in Precision Medicine for Neurological Disorders 100%, Basel, temporary",2019-11-16,ETH Zürich,Zürich,100%,Position with responsibilities,"PhD Position in Precision Medicine for Neurological Disorders 100%, Basel, temporaryPhD Position in Precision Medicine for Neurological Disorders 100%, Basel, temporary  The Machine Learning and Computational Biology Laboratory at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) is seeking a PhD Student in the field of Machine Learning for Health to start on January 1st, 2020. The student will be joining a highly interdisciplinary research team and will be supervised by Dr. Catherine Jutzeler and Prof. Karsten Borgwardt. The Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) is one of ETH Zurich's youngest departments and the only one located in Basel outside of the Zurich campus. It unites biologists, engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians to work towards a quantitative understanding and purposeful engineering of complex biological systems.  Job description  The PhD student will be funded by Dr. Catherine Jutzeler’s recently awarded Swiss National Science Foundation Ambizione Grant on precision medicine for neurological disorders. The focus of this project will be on traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, with the potential to expand to other neurological conditions. Both disorders, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, are highly heterogenous in terms of clinical presentation, disease progression, and associated comorbidities. This heterogeneity makes reliable prediction of future outcomes and patient stratification for clinical trials extremely challenging. The aims of this project are to (1) identify biomarkers that allow a better characterization of the patients (e.g., identification of homogenous subgroups, phenotypes, responders and non-responders); and (2) expedite the search for disease-modifying treatments through drug repurposing. To implicitly account for the multifaceted nature of the disorders, state-of-the-art machine learning methods will be applied to analyze multidimensional medical data (clinical, imaging, genetic, behavioral, and physiological), derived from completed clinical trials, health records, and observational studies. Machine learning topics relevant to the project include mining and learning on time series and graphs, kernel methods, graph kernels, multiple testing correction in ultra-high-dimensional spaces, feature selection in structured spaces, deep learning, and causal inference.   Your profile  Applicants should be highly motivated and creative, hold a Master’s Degree in computer science, bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics, medicine, or related fields. Moreover, candidates must be able to fluently communicate in English (oral and written) and be willing to work in a highly interactive, interdisciplinary, and international environment at the interface of machine learning and biomedicine. Academic excellence, a professional work attitude, and a proactive and self-driven work ethic are expected. Advanced computer skills, including use of statistical software such as R, Python, or C++ are an asset. The position is fully funded for 4 years, and it will be located in the Machine Learning and Computational Biology Laboratory at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at the ETH Campus in Basel. Ideally, the position should start on January 1, 2020.  ETH Zurich   ETH Zurich is one of the world’s leading universities specialising in science and technology. We are renowned for our excellent education, cutting-edge fundamental research and direct transfer of new knowledge into society. Over 30,000 people from more than 120 countries find our university to be a place that promotes independent thinking and an environment that inspires excellence.

Data Scientist,"Postdoctoral Researcher in ocean modeling 100%, Zurich, temporary",2019-11-16,ETH Zürich,Zürich,100%,Position with responsibilities,"Postdoctoral Researcher in ocean modeling 100%, Zurich, temporaryPostdoctoral Researcher in ocean modeling 100%, Zurich, temporary  The Environmental Physics Group is a vibrant interdisciplinary team of researchers studying climate and oceans from regional to global scales.  Project background  A region of particular interest is the Southern Ocean, given its pivotal role in taking up heat and carbon from the atmosphere, thus being the most important oceanic region mitigating current climate change. In this context, we are searching for a postdoctoral researcher in ocean modeling within the framework of the SO-CHIC project funded by the European Commission (https://sc5.easme-web.eu/?p=821001). The objective of this postdoctoral project is to quantify the uptake of heat and carbon in the Southern Ocean and the subsequent transport and storage of these two quantities in the ocean’s interior. To this end, we will use a combination of observations and numerical models, benefitting from the close collaborations with the other members of the SO-CHIC consortium and the rich set of new observations that will be gathered as part of the project. A particular focus of the project will be the determination of the role of sea-ice and polynyas in modulating this uptake in recent decades. The core modeling tool is the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) configured for the entire Southern Ocean at full eddy resolving resolution.  Job description  The successful applicant will extend ROMS to better represent sea-ice, and then work with this extended model and observations to establish the seasonal to annual budgets for heat and carbon in the Southern Ocean and the similarities and differences between the two quantities. Of particular interest is the determination of the sensitivity of the uptake to changes in the state of the Southern Hemisphere climate system, especially to changes in the wind forcing and the surface buoyancy fluxes (including changes in sea-ice regime and glacial freshwater input). The postdoc will thereby interact closely with colleagues at the other partner institutions involved in SO-CHIC, especially LOCEAN-IPSL in Paris and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven. The postdoctoral researcher will work in the Environmental Physics group of Prof. Nicolas Gruber and will collaborate closely with Dr. Matthias Münnich (senior scientist). The starting date of this position is late 2019 to early 2020. The position is guaranteed for two years with the possibility for a third-year extension.  Your profile  The ideal applicant has a Ph.D. degree in atmospheric, oceanic and/or climate sciences, environmental physics, or a closely related discipline with substantial expertise in modeling or advanced methods in data analyses. You have very good oral and written English skills, you are a good communicator, you like to work in an interdisciplinary and international environment, and you have demonstrated the ability to lead projects and write publications.
