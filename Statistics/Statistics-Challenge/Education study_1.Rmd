X5 – gender m/f ( 1/2)
X6 – marital status, single/not (1/0)
X7 – importance of having experience abroad (1/0) – Q1
X8 – studied, never studied (0/1) -Q6

X.. – Benefits of study abroad ( for those who already was) -Q3
X… – Reasons why not to go ( for those who never been) – Q4

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
