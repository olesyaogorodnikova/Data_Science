Exercise 1: Calculating Central Tendency
Use the ”baseball.csv“ data set. Choose five variables in the data and for each:
Calculate the mean, median and mode.
Explain for each variable, which of the three central tendencies is the best to represent the variable and why.
Are any of the measures for the central tendency misleading? Why?
Bonus: produce a histogram of the data, with vertical lines showing the mean, median, and mode.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("baseball_.csv")
head(data)

```


```{r}
ds <-data[c(8,9,10,13,15)]
head(ds)
```


```{r}
apply(ds,2,mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```


```{r}
apply(na.omit(ds),2,median)
```


```{r}
mod <- function(n) {
  ux <- unique(n)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(n, ux)))]
}
mod(ds$ab)

ab = na.omit(ds$ab)
mod(data$year)



```


```{r}
summary(ds$ab)
```


```{r}
ggplot(ds, aes(x=ab))+ 
  geom_histogram(binwidth =10)+ geom_vline(aes(xintercept=131), color="blue", size=2)+ geom_vline(aes(xintercept=225), color="red", size=2)+ geom_vline(aes(xintercept=0), color="green",size=2)
```

Exercise 2: Detect Outliers with IQR Rule
Use the ”Employee.compensation.csv“ data set. Identify outliers for the variable “Total.Compensation”.
Explain what rule applies in the outlier and how you could identify them in the R-Output.
Helpful R-functions: quantile(), IQR(), boxplot()
Bonus: Detect outliers with the rule [mean - t * SD, mean + t * SD], with t = 3.



```{r}
data2 <- read.csv("Employee.Compensation_.csv")
data2
str(data2$Total.Compensation) 
```


```{r}

q = data2$Total.Compensation
s = data2$Salaries
c = data2$Total.Benefits


boxplot(q,s,c)
```


```{r}
quantiles <- quantile(q)
quantiles
```


```{r}
IQR(q)
```


```{r}
above = quantiles["75%"] + 1.5*IQR(q)
above
below = quantiles["25%"] - 1.5*IQR(q)
below


q1 = mean(q)+3*sd(q)
q1
q2 = mean(q)-3*sd(q)
q2


```



```{r}
summary(q)
```


Exercise 3: Standard deviations
What is the population standard deviation for the numbers: 75, 83, 96, 100, 121 and 125?


```{r}
x <- c(75, 83, 96, 100, 121, 125)    
std = sqrt(sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(6))  
std  

```

Ten friends scored the following marks in their end-of-year math exam: 23%, 37%, 45%, 49%, 56%, 63%, 63%, 70%, 72% and 82%. What was the standard deviation of their marks?



```{r}

x1 <- c(23, 37, 45, 49, 56, 63, 63, 70, 72, 82)
std = sqrt(sum((x1 - mean(x1))^2)/(10))  
std
```

A booklet has 12 pages with the following numbers of words: 271, 354, 296, 301, 333, 326, 285, 298, 327, 316, 287 and 314. What is the standard deviation number of words per page?


```{r}
x2 <- c(271, 354, 296, 301, 333, 326, 285, 298, 327, 316, 287, 314)
std = sqrt(sum((x2 - mean(x2))^2)/(12))
std
```

How does the standard deviation change, when each of the five numbers is increased by 2. Argue non-numerically.

will not change

```{r}
x3<- x2*2
x3 <- c(271, 354, 296, 301, 333, 326, 285, 298, 327, 316, 287, 314)
std = sqrt(sum((x3 - mean(x3))^2)/(12))
std

```

Bonus: write an R-function for the computation of the variance either with a for-loop or with the function apply() (more advanced). Show for one of the examples above that your function is correct.

```{r}
svarf <- function(x) {
    s = 0
    for (i in 1:length(x)) {
      s <- s + x[i]
    }
    a = s / length(x)
    s = 0
    for (i in 1: length(x)) {
      s <- s + (x[i]-a)^2
     }
    return(s/(length(x)-1))
  }

h <- heights <- c(271, 354, 296, 301, 333, 326, 285, 298, 327, 316, 287, 314)

var =svarf(h)
sqrt(var)
```


Exercise 5: Distributions
Generate the following figure of a normal distribution with different parameters values using rnorm().

```{r}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-5, 5)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, color="red", size = 1, args = list(mean = 0, sd = sqrt(0.2))) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, color="blue", size = 1, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, color="yellow", size = 1, args = list(mean = 0, sd = sqrt(5))) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, color="black", size = 1, args = list(mean = -2, sd = sqrt(0.5)))

```


```{r}

```{r}
##Assume you have a population of people whose heights are described by Height ~ N (170, 7):
n <- 10
v <- round(rnorm(10, 170, 7))
print(v)
```


```{r}
## What percent of the population is between 170 and 175cm tall?
ans1 <- 0
for (i in 1:n) {
	if (v[i]>=170 && v[i]<=175) ans1 <- ans1 + 1
}
ans1 <- round(100.0*ans1/n,2)
```

v[n/2] <- 168
print(v)
cnt <- sum(v < 168)
ans2 <- round(100.0*cnt/n,2)
cat(ans2,"%") 


print(1-pnorm(168, 170, 7))

```


```{r}
# Find an interval that includes 50% of the population.
value_lower = qnorm(0.25, mean=170, sd=7)
value_lower
value_higher = qnorm(0.75, mean=170, sd=7)
value_higher

```


```{r}
#Find an interval that includes 20% of the population.
value_lower2 = qnorm(0.4, mean=170, sd=7)
value_lower2
value_higher2 = qnorm(0.6, mean=170, sd=7)
value_higher2

    v <- c()
	for (i in 1:n)
	{
		if (runif(1)<=p)
			v <- c(v, 1)
		else
			v <- c(v, 0)
	}
	return(v)
}
mb = myBinomial(10, 0.9)
print(mb)


```


```{r}
myBinomial <- function(n, p) {
    draws <- numeric(n)
        for (i in 1:n){
            if (runif(1) <= (p)) {
                draws[i] <- 1 }
            else { 
                draws[i] <-0
        }
    }

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
